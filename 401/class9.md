Dunder methods (short for "double underscore" methods) in Python are special methods that are used to define the behavior of objects in Python. They are also known as magic methods or special methods. These methods have two underscores before and after the method name, such as __init__() or __add__(). Dunder methods provide a way to customize the behavior of built-in Python methods or operators for specific classes. For example, __add__() method can be used to define how the + operator should work for instances of a class. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the way objects behave in Python.

like 
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."

person = Person("John", 30)
print(person) # Output: John is 30 years old.
In the video "AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course," the main ethical issue raised concerns the use of developers' work without proper attribution or compensation. The AI Guru allegedly used code and materials created by other developers without giving credit or compensation to them. This violates ethical principles of fairness, honesty, and respect for intellectual property. To avoid such ethical issues, developers should properly acknowledge and compensate other developers for their work and obtain permission before using their code or materials.
The Python statistics module is a built-in module that provides functions for statistical analysis in Python. It includes functions for calculating basic statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient. Here's an example of a function within the module that can be used to calculate the mean of a list of numbers:

import statistics
numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
print(mean) # Output: 5.6

mean() function from the statistics module is used to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The result is then printed to the console.
