## Data Structures and Algorithms

1.Consider is the efficiency of the data structure in terms of time and space complexity. Different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one can have a significant impact on the performance of your solution.

2.Make sure that your recursive function has a base case that will eventually terminate the recursion. The base case should be a simple case that can be solved directly, without making any further recursive calls.
