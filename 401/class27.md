## Prep for SQL

I view the relational database as a digital filing cabinet, and SQL as the language used to sort through and retrieve specific files within that cabinet. So, if you want to find a specific file in the filing cabinet, you would use SQL to search for it based on certain criteria, such as its name, date, or category.

      A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a different type of data, and the columns within each table represent specific attributes of that data.

      SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to manage and manipulate data within a relational database. It allows users to create, modify, and query data in a relational database
