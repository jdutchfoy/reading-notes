## Read Assignment 8

1. Flexbox can be wrapped into multiple lines, but it's impossible to get the second row to line up with the first row.

2. The main axis is set by flex-direction property and can be a row or column. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex direction` is a row the cross axis is a column.

3. Reversing the flow of items of how they are ordered in the HTML document.

4. Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.

Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.

Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content

It is pushing my preference to back end developer more and more.
