 ##READ ASSIGNMENT 2##

1.we need to make sure we are using the correct elements, giving our content the correct meaning, function, or appearance.
2.There are six levels of headings defined by HTML. These 6 heading elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6; with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.

* <h1> is used for the main heading. (Biggest in size)
* <h2> is used for subheadings, if there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> elements are used.
* <h6> for the small heading (smallest one).

3.The tag <sub> is defined as subscript in html.  It is widely used to place subscripted text on web pages.
It is a paired tag. It has a start tag <sub> and closing tag </sub> Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
We can see on science-related websites Subscript is used to write chemical compounds. Ex. <sub>Sub-scripted</sub> Text.
The <sup> tag is used to define the superscript text on web pages. Superscript and Subscript are often used in mathematical expression and chemical compounds. Ex.  (a+b)<sup>2 </sup>= a<sup>2</sup>+2ab+b<sup>2</sup>
4. Title  is used to specify extra information about the element. When the mouse moves over the element then it shows the information

1.External stylesheet
An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML <link> element:The href attribute of the <link> element needs to reference a file on your file system. In the example above, the CSS file is in the same folder as the HTML document, but you could place it somewhere else and adjust the path.

Internal stylesheet
An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a <style> element contained inside the HTML <head>.

Inline styles
Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute.Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible. It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.
There are a few circumstances where inline styles are more common. You might have to resort to using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive. For example, perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body. You may also see a lot of inline styles in HTML email to achieve compatibility with as many email clients as possible.

a. h2
B. Color: black;
C. Padding: 5px

4.Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Operators
4.
Addition Add two numbers together or combine two strings. + 6 + 9;
'Hello ' + 'world!';
Subtraction, Multiplication, Division These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math. -, *, / 9 - 3;
8* 2; // multiply in JS is an asterisk
9 / 3;
Assignment As you've seen already: this assigns a value to a variable. = let myVariable = 'Bob';
5.
a.The logical AND (&&) (logical conjunction) operator for a set of boolean operands will be true if and only if all the operands are true. Otherwise it will be false.
More generally, the operator returns the value of the first falsy operand encountered when evaluating from left to right, or the value of the last operand if they are all truthy.
b.The logical OR (||) (logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value. However, the || operator actually returns the value of one of the specified operands, so if this operator is used with non-Boolean values, it will return a non-Boolean value.
