Read Assignment 5

The user is visually impaired, and is using a screen reader to read the web out to them. In fact, having alt text available to describe images is useful to most users.
As described above, the spelling of the file or path name might be wrong.
The browser doesn't support the image type. Some people still use text-only browsers, such as Lynx, which displays the alt text of images.
You may want to provide text for search engines to utilize; for example, search engines can match alt text with search queries.
Users have turned off images to reduce data transfer volume and distractions. This is especially common on mobile phones, and in countries where bandwidth is limited or expensive.

    2.  Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad) markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:
Easier to develop with — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
Better on mobile — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
Good for SEO — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic <div>s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by customers.

3. The HTML <figure> element represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (<figcaption>), and is typically referenced as a single unit. How does the figure tag work in HTML5? The <figure> tag is new in HTML5. Tip: The <figcaption> element is used to add a caption for the <figure> element.

4.svg files are actually code–a series of mathematical equations that define shapes, colors, and size. This is why they retain their high quality no matter how much you scale them. But it also means you can’t upload them to Squarespace the same way you would upload a jpg, png, or gif. You have to copy and paste the svg code into a code block instead. VS Gif stands for Graphics Interchange Format and it’s best known for supporting animation. Like png files, gifs are inherently lossless but they actually take up a lot more space than png images. In fact, png is basically just an updated version of gif with some key differentiating characteristics.hey have weak support for transparency, only have 256 colors, and will slow your website down. Animation is the one area in which they are truly useful.

5.If you need to screen capture a program window on your screen, dialog boxes, splash screens or Google Maps, use the PNG format. The advantage with PNG is that it preserves all the colors and yield a much sharper output when compared with JPG. See this Photoshop splash screen for a comparison between JPEG and PNG quality.
The PNG format is also recommended for capturing web pages, logos and line art.

6.Foreground colors are what you want your HTML elements to be, and background colors are those which you'd like layered behind them.

7.Incorporating alike color combinations to various items like text, border, and background to set a theme depending on the topic of the blog.

8.Ensure the website offers web safe font, meaning it will appear on the browser my webpage is running on. Foreground, size and weight are items to include, in addition to making sure the font is still readable and not to big or small.

9.Font size measures how big the text will be, font weight will measure how bold the font is, and font style will turn italics on or off.

10.Line height is the easiest way, but you can also use padding to make space for the h1.
