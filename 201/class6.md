An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects). Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

2.  provides a shorter syntax for creating/initializing properties from variables (Property Shorthand). Provides a shorter syntax for defining function methods. It enables the ability to have computed property names in an object’s literal definition.

3. array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store a list of elements and access them by a single variable. Array of objects: It stores multiple values in a single variable. The object can contain anything in the real world such as person names, cars, game characters. Objects are very easy to use in some situations if you know where the data is being processed. The character set of objects are known as Properties. Properties of an object can be called by using DOT notation and [] notation.

4.Bracket notation provides an alternative way to access object properties. Instead of using dot notation 

EX. 
person["age"];
person[“name”]["first"];   instead of dot notation like this.       person.age; person.name.first;

6.The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. This guide will introduce the DOM, look at how the DOM represents an HTML document in memory and how to use APIs to create web content and applications.

7. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts. The document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts of the document object model for that document. They can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.

8.The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used in other contexts. For example, Node.js runs JavaScript programs on a computer, but provides a different set of APIs, and the DOM API is not a core part of the Node.js runtime.
The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API. Even if most web developers will only use the DOM through JavaScript, implementations of the DOM can be built for any language, as this Python example demonstrates
