## Read Assignment 10

1.Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.
	
	2.spell check for code
	
	3.Breakpoints pause your program once execution reaches a certain point. You can then step through the program line by line, observing its execution and inspecting the contents of your variables.

There are three ways of creating breakpoints.
From code, using the debugger; statement.
From the browser, using the Developer Tools.
From an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

4. Call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, program stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just "the stack”.
