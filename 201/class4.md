## Read Assignment 4 Notes 

Read Assignment 4


1. A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.   EX 
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.

2. Href contains the web address information

3. Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title. The title contains additional information about the link, such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website. Aides with accessibility to all readers.

4. By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements — except for images. Unlike other inline elements, images can be resized without changing their display property. If you want to control the size of an inline element in this manner, you need to set it to behave like a block level element (e.g., with display: block; or display: inline-block;, which mixes characteristics from both).

5. Static positioning  is the default for every  html element 

6.a.gaps where the positioned element should be in the document flow is no longer there — the first and third elements have closed together like it no longer exists! Well, in a way, this is true. An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on.

b.Second, notice that the position of the element has changed. This is because top, bottom, left, and right behave in a different way with absolute positioning. Rather than positioning the element based on its relative position within the normal document flow, they specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides. So in this case, we are saying that the absolutely positioned element should sit 30px from the top of the "containing element" and 30px from the left.

7. Fixed positioning works in exactly the same way as absolute positioning, with one key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (An exception to this occurs if one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing block because its transform property has a value other than none.) This means that you can create useful UI items that are fixed in place, like persistent navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls.

8. The function declaration defines a function with the specified parameters.To actually use a function after it has been defined, you've got to run — or invoke — it. This is done by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.
