CF Journal

Greetings, my name is **Dutch** I am a new *student* to the tech community and excited about exploring and learning something new. I interpret growth mindset as your sucess is only be limited by you. It might take you longer to achieve a goal than someone else but stay the course and you will eventually achieve your goal. A wise person recently told me that comparison is the thief of joy, and SUCCESS. Stay the course you will get there!

I have enclosed a link to my [github profile](https://www.github.com/jdutchfoy) have a look around.
