## Read Assignment 14

1. A change occurred in 1980, Professors assumed that their students grew up playing or were familiar with computers at home. When personal computers were introduced (games and such), people at that time believed that it was designed for boys and not for girls. Boys at that time had more advantage learning and playing with computers because they believed it wasn't meant for girls. When it comes to college, women who studied computer science, or at least tried to, were way behind compared to their male classmates.

2. The idea became a narrative that playing on computers only belongs to males, not females. It became a problem when women entered college to study Computer Science. Their knowledge was way behind, and the Professors expected more or assumed that their knowledge level must have matched the knowledge of their male students who grew up playing and were familiar with computers. There were no equal opportunities.
