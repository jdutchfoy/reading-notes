## Reading Assignment 11

known as Relational Database (RDBMS)
is a table-based database; it represents data in form of tables
has pre-defined schema
uses structured query language or SQL for manipulating or defining the data
are vertically scalable, increases the horsepower of the hardware
VS
known as non-relational database
are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases (or wide-column stores)
has dynamic schema
queries known as unstructured query language or UnQL, which focuses on document collection
are horizontally, " scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load [^1]"

2. the SQL databases are good for complex queries; it is suited for storing structured data.

3.Examples of data that can be stored and process using SQL are:
zip codes
city
state
dates
ID numbers
credit card numbers
Most relational databases support permission access, which means it defines who can read data and who is allowed to make changes on the data.

4.Data with different forms or structures are good fit and easy to handle with NoSQL database 1. NoSQL can store and model data that are structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, in one database 1. It reduces "the need for translation from the form the data is stored in to the form the data takes in the code" - from When to Use a NoSQL Database.

Give a real-world example.
It allows the developers "o be in control of the structure of the data"; "they are a good fit with modern Agile development practices based on sprints, quick iterations, and frequent code pushes 1".

5.NoSQL databases are better for hierarchical data storage as it follows or uses the key-value pair when storing data, similar to JSON [^1].

6.Scalability in SQL (vertically scalable)can be managed by increasing the RAM, CPU, or SSD on one server, while NoSQL (horizontally scalable), can easily add servers "to handle the large traffic [^1]".

SQL vs NoSQL (Video)

6.SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

7.A relational database is a database that supports the SQL language 2. It is a database that "stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another 2". The data is stored and distributed across are then connected through relations; the SQL can query these relations through some commands (ex. join) which can retrieve these connected data 2.

8.The relational database supports data structures like forms, table data, data views and indexes. It supports logical data structures 2. It organizes and provides access to data points which makes it easier to access.

9.The schema refers to as a database organization or structure.

10.NoSQL are document based, it stores data as key-value pairs, graph databases (or wide-column stores) [^1]. It is best fit for hierarchical data storage.

11.MOngoDB is a database that stores one or more document collections. It "stores data records as documents", gathered as documents 3.
